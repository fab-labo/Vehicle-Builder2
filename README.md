# Module 08 Challenge: Vehicle Builder

## Description

This project presents a unique opportunity to deepen our expertise in TypeScript by addressing a range of tasks and challenges. We developed specialized functions for Trucks and Motorbikes, each with distinct features. One key functionality is the system's ability to identify the vehicle type—whether a truck, car, or motorbike—and dynamically generate a tailored set of questions specific to each category.
